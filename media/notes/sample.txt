 Photosynthesis is the vital process where plants, algae, and some microorganisms convert light energy into chemical energy to create food.\'a0Plants take in carbon dioxide through their leaves and water through their roots, and using chlorophyll to capture sunlight, they transform these into glucose (sugar) and oxygen.\'a0This glucose fuels the plant, while the oxygen is released into the atmosphere, sustaining nearly all life on Earth and forming the base of most food chains.
